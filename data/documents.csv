0,hainanese-chicken-rice,Chicken Rice,"This delectable dish can be found at almost every dining spot, from humble hawker centres to high-end restaurants. While there are many different variations of chicken rice, the Hainanese version consists of poached chicken, rice cooked in chicken stock and a chilli dipping sauce. Depending on your preference, you can choose between either roasted or boiled chicken at many of the hawker stalls in Singapore. When you see succulent cooked chicken hanging neatly in a row at a food stall, you are looking at one of the nation's favourite dishes—Hainanese Chicken Rice. A ubiquitous sight in hawker centres across the country, it is also on the menu in many major restaurants and even hotel cafés. All offer the same dish at varying prices: bite-sized slices of chicken—or a whole chicken if you’re eating as a big group—served with fragrant rice, spicy chilli and ginger paste. The recipe for the dish is adapted from early Chinese immigrants from Hainan Island, off the southern coast of China. Back in Hainan, locals call the dish ""Wenchang chicken"". They use a particular fowl that is bony and fibrous, and serve the chicken with oily rice. A ground green chilli dip rounds off the dish. Singapore-style chicken rice. The cooking method hails back to its Hainanese roots, with a few uniquely Singaporean twists. The chicken is steeped in boiling water or blanched till it is fully cooked, before soaking it in cold water to ensure the meat remains tender. In a local twist, the chicken can also be roasted or braised in soya sauce for a different taste. In Singapore, the dish is infused with local Cantonese influences which inspired the tangy red chilli sauce dip and the use of tender and young chicken. It is, however, the rice and chilli sauce that can make or break the dish. The rice, cooked in chicken stock with ginger and pandan leaves, should have just the right amount of oiliness, while the chilli must possess the right blend of both spiciness and sourness.

1,laksa,Laksa,"The laksa broth offers the right balance of spice and coconut milk, a distinctive noodle soup that will tickle the tastebuds. This spicy noodle soup dish is the perfect comfort food for rainy days, and is bound to both fill your belly and tickle your tastebuds. There are various types of laksa (spicy coconut milk-based noodle soup) in Singapore–from the tamarind-tang of Penang laksa to the curry-like Sarawak laksa. But none is more famous than our home-grown Katong laksa. Katong laksa is inspired by the Peranakans* who live in the Katong area. It has a spicy soup stock the colour of a flaming sunset, flavoured with coconut milk and dried shrimp, and topped with ingredients like cockles, prawns and fishcake. Its defining characteristic is the noodles: thick vermicelli cut into shorter pieces that can be easily slurped up with a spoon. At some stalls, you only get a spoon to eat the laksa–no chopsticks needed. The taste is so sought-after that Katong laksa has travelled beyond the east to reach every corner in Singapore, due to franchising and enterprising laksa stalls imitating the flavours. *The term is an Indonesian/Malay word that means “local born”, which generally refers to people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage. Turf wars. Over the years, many are confused about its authenticity as every stall in Katong claims to be the original. There is the more well-known 'janggut' version, named after the hawker who sprouts a few hairs from a mole below his chin, hence his nickname, 'janggut'–which means beard in Malay. This stall—aptly named Janggut Laksa—is now helmed by his family, and operates from Queensway Shopping Centre. There are also other reputable stalls along the Katong stretch, each selling the same tasting dish that has come to define the Singapore laksa. The difference is that normal laksa requires chopsticks to scoop up the uncut noodles.",https://www.visitsingapore.com/dining-drinks-singapore/local-dishes/laksa/
2,rojak,Rojak,"Dark and sticky, the salad may not look very appealing at first; but tuck into this culinary marvel and you’ll be amazed by the delicious mix of sweet and savoury. Just like Singaporean cuisine in general, rojak is a dish that boasts multi-ethnic diversity and myriad variations in taste and ingredients. Ground peanuts are an essential component in traditional rojak, and serve to enhance the dish’s complex textures. Rojak means an “eclectic mix” in colloquial Malay, and the dish sure lives up to its name. Its ingredients reflect the cultural diversity of Singapore, bringing together disparate items with strong flavours into a harmoniously tasty blend. It is a local salad of mixed vegetables, fruits, and dough fritters that is covered in a sticky black sauce and garnished with chopped peanuts and finely-cut fragrant ginger flowers for a piquant taste. The mark of a good rojak is its sauce, made up of fermented prawn paste, sugar, lime and chilli paste. It must be an appetising mix of sweet, sour and spicy. The sauce is traditionally mixed in a large wooden bowl with a wooden spoon. Only when the sauce is complete are the ingredients added and thoroughly mixed.  These include blanched kang kong (water spinach) and beansprout, crunchy raw cucumber and Chinese turnip, tangy-tasting fruits like sliced pineapple, young mangoes or jambu (unripe rose apples), fried dough fritters and toasted beancurd. Rojak history. No one really knows the origins of rojak as Asia boasts many variations of the dish. These include the Indonesia gado-gado with rice cakes and vegetables drenched in a peanut sauce to the Indian rojak whose peanut sauce is fiery orange in colour and used as a dip for its ingredients like fried dough, potatoes and steamed squid. Rojak is typically sold by Chinese hawkers. Until the 1980s, rojak sellers could still be found, often illegally, moving through neighbourhoods on bicycles. Today, they have found a home in most food centres throughout the city.",https://www.visitsingapore.com/dining-drinks-singapore/local-dishes/rojak/
3,roti-prata,Roti Prata,"This Indian specialty is pleasing to the palate and the eye. Watch the prata-maker stretch the dough by slapping and swinging it in one skilful motion. This savoury, belly-filling dish is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, but tasty throughout. While you certainly can eat prata with a fork, true blue locals tend to eschew cutlery and use their fingers. Don’t be shy to try it out for yourself!. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, roti prata hits the spot every time. A South-Indian flat bread made by frying stretched dough flavoured with ghee (Indian clarified butter), it is usually served with fish or mutton curry. Roti means 'bread', and prata or paratha means 'flat' in Hindi. Some believe the dish evolved from original pancake recipes from Punjab in India, but across the causeway in Malaysia, the flat bread is called roti canai, which some say is a nod to its origins from Chennai. No matter where it comes from, roti prata is a satisfying meal for any hour of the day. While the classic versions are served plain or with eggs as a filling, local menus now feature a variety of modern variations such as cheese, chocolate, ice-cream, and even durians – turning it from a main course to a dessert. Different doughs. Between the many prata stalls in Singapore, many opening till late in the night, the texture of the dough differs - ranging from soft and chewy to super crispy, with most being somewhere in the middle of flaky and fluffy. The most difficult part of prata-making is stretching the dough, and it is a sight to behold. Watch how the prata-man whirls and twirls the dough until it is paper thin and four or five times larger than the original piece. After folding this thin piece into a rectangle, he cooks the prata on a greased griddle. The recommended way to eat it: dig in with your fingers!.",https://www.visitsingapore.com/dining-drinks-singapore/local-dishes/roti-prata/

27,iconic-souvenirs-of-singapore,Iconic souvenirs of Singapore,"Editor’s Note: We understand that even as travelling is on pause now and the world is staying home, the following article may inspire you to visit Singapore next when the situation has improved and travel is made possible again. You may consider ordering some of the souvenirs online where international shipping is available. Meanwhile, please stay safe. Singapore awaits your next visit. Singapore is a teeming hotbed of locally designed and crafted products. Several emblems of our diverse, unique nation can be brought home by tourists, in the form of quirky and functional souvenirs. Nuanced labours of love crafted by Singapore’s growing artisanal community, these thoughtfully fashioned items are not only functional—they’re symbols of our many cultures and ethnicities. Old school. Eu Yan Sang—herbal remedies. An iconic dispensary of traditional Chinese medicine, Eu Yan Sang stocks a plethora of herbal remedies, which have been proven effective against everything from common colds and flus, to high blood pressure and cardiovascular ailments. Biscuit King—traditional sweets. As you explore Singapore’s eclectic neighbourhoods, pop into a mama shop (traditional sundries store) to buy some local candy. While children today crave trendy desserts and sweets, treats like ais gem (iced gem biscuits) and haw flakes (Chinese sweets made from the Chinese hawthorn) were integral parts of many Singaporeans’ childhoods. If you’re finding it a bit difficult to hunt down this hidden treasure, you can drop by Biscuit King along Casuarina Road. This old school store is a trove of nostalgic snacks and retro candies. Loof—nostalgic knicknacks. Toys from the pre-electronics era may not be on the wish lists of kids today, but you can still find some of these knickknacks by purchasing them at Loof, an acclaimed rooftop bar in the Civic District. Prima Taste/Hais—local condiments and ingredients. Make your own version of traditional Singaporean dishes at home—go for instant pastes and powders by Prima Taste and Hais, both of which offer Halal-certified, ready-to-cook versions of laksa (spicy coconut milk-based noodle soup), Hainanese chicken rice and Cantonese soups, among others. These household brands are available at most supermarkets here. Tiger Beer—the granddaddy of local brews. Don’t leave Singapore without having a can or pint of Tiger Beer, our home-grown brew that has found acclaim all around the world. Besides the usual light lager, the suds now come in two new variations: wheat beer and dark lager. Tiger Balm—A local ointment to soothe discomfort. Soothe your aches and pains with Tiger Balm, a traditional ointment that can be found in most convenience stores and supermarkets. Locals have been dabbing the elixir on their sore joints and muscles for almost a century, and some even claim it helps with headaches and colds. Even if you don’t suffer from any of these ailments, Tiger Balm’s iconic hexagonal bottle—the design of which hasn’t changed much since it launched—makes for a great curio for your home. New school. Archipelago Brewery—Craft brews in iconic beer bottles. Singlish got you stumped? Perhaps the new beers from Archipelago Brewery can help. The local microbrewery has launched a range of beers that bear cheeky, Singlish-inspired names such as Sibeh Ho Witbier (“sibeh ho” is Hokkien for “extremely good”) and Ki Siao Brown Ale (“ki siao” is Hokkien for “go insane”). TWG—Tea for the discerning connoisseur. Tea-lovers, you’ll find your sanctuary at one of the tea salons of Singapore’s home-grown luxury tea brand, TWG. Pick up a beautiful tea tin containing your blend of choice—local versions of international strains include the Singapore Breakfast Tea and the Weekend in Singapore—or a box of exotic loose tea leaves.

Visit local goldsmith and jeweller Risis, and browse a collection of orchid-inspired jewellery. Littered with Books/BooksActually—Literary gems from local authors. Leaf through books by local authors at boutique bookstores like Littered with Books or BooksActually. From poetry collections to short story compilations to bona fide novels, you’ll find that the Singaporean literary scene is brimming with talent. One book you have to check out is The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye by Sonny Liew. It’s a sprawling graphic novel—and winner of an Eisner Award—that presents a fictionalised account of our history. Supermama/Scene Shang—Homeware for your abode. If you’d like to purchase some locally made crockery and furniture, head to Supermama and Scene Shang, located side by side in Kampong Gelam.

29,meeting-li-ruifang-third-generation-chef-owner,"Meet Li Ruifang, third generation hawker chef-owner","Before helming 545 Whampoa Prawn Noodles… I worked in multinational corporation (MNC) for a few years, but couldn’t find purpose in my job. I quit the company and found myself helping out at my father’s stall while considering my options. Eventually, I opened my own stall in Tekka, and it was one of the best decisions I’ve made. A solid bowl of prawn noodles… should have a flavoursome broth. I use only wild-caught prawns for the sweetness they give. For dry prawn noodles, the balance of the condiments is crucial. What I love most about Singapore… is the variety of food options on the island. You can find all kinds of cuisines from Mexican to Russian. I’ve lived in… Ang Mo Kio all my life, and I grew up eating all the delicious local food from the hawker centres in the neighbourhood, like the food centre at 628 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4, and the coffeeshop at 151 Ang Mo Kio Ave 5. If you only have time for one place in Little India… make it Tekka Centre. It’s a wet market, food centre and shopping mall rolled into one, offering everything from casual clothing and religious paraphernalia to fresh produce and local food from several ethnic communities. New Ubin Seafood… serves one of the city’s best black pepper crabs. It has a unique smoky taste that doesn’t undermine the freshness of the crustacean. Their US Angus ribeye, seasoned simply and perfectly cooked, is also worth having. I am very proud… to be living in Singapore. I feel safe going out in the middle of the night for a supper—streets are brightly lit, and there are many eateries that are open 24 hours a day. My go-to supper spots are 126 Wan Dou Sek in Geylang for dim sum (bite-sized portions of food served in steamer baskets or small plates), and Ming Fa Fishball in Bedok.",https://www.visitsingapore.com/editorials/meeting-li-ruifang-third-generation-chef-owner/
30,michelin-eats-with-a-singapore-flavour,Michelin eats with a Singapore flavour,"Singapore is certainly a slice of heaven for food lovers: With 69 establishments being awarded the Michelin Bib Gourmand and 49 eateries nabbing Michelin stars in 2021, the number of quality food options on offer in our sunny city can certainly seem endless. Which begs the question: Where does one begin?. No matter where you hail from, you’re certain to find a local food option that will broaden your culinary horizons, excite your palate and add to your memories of unforgettable dining experiences. From traditional favourites to bold interpretations of these classics—also known as modern-Singaporean cuisine (Mod-Sin)—here’s the lowdown on some of the culinary gems the Lion City has to offer. Local culture on a plate. Hailing from a hybrid heritage unique to this region, Peranakan* food is a blend of Chinese ingredients with the various distinct spices and cooking techniques of the Malay community, and an apt symbol of Singapore’s melting pot of ethnic cultures. To experience how tradition and originality merge into new forms, pay a visit to Candlenut. Helmed by local chef-owner Malcolm Lee, Candlenut is the world’s first and only Michelin-starred Peranakan restaurant. The establishment serves innovative dishes that both modernise and pay homage to traditional Peranakan flavours, including buah keluak (black nut indigenous to Southeast Asia) ice cream and Westholme Wagyu Beef rendang (braised meat cooked in coconut milk and spices). Alternatively, drop by Michelin Bib Gourmand eatery True Blue Cuisine for Peranakan fare that eschews innovation for traditional preparation. Located in the Peranakan Museum along Armenian Street, this restaurant has been dishing out authentic Peranakan delicacies (without pork or lard) since 2003. Chef-owner Benjamin Seck started True Blue Cuisine with the assistance of his mother, serving traditional dishes like minced chicken ngoh hiang (meat rolled in beancurd skin) and udang ketak (crayfish fried in spicy paste). The traditional décor, beautiful antiques and sweet scent of bunga rampai (a potpourri of flowers and leaves) culminate in a multisensory dining experience for food lovers. *The term is an Indonesian/Malay word that means “local born”, which generally refers to people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage.

With a legion of hawkers serving up local dishes, Singapore is home to some of the world’s most affordable Michelin-starred meals, many of which can be found in Singapore’s traditional enclaves, from the bustling streets of Chinatown to the vibrant district of Little India. To get a taste of Singapore’s long tradition of excellent street food, pay a visit to the Michelin Bib Gourmand-awarded Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa. Located in the bustling Hong Lim Market, this stall dishes out a delicious rendition of laksa (spicy, coconut-based noodle soup), a beloved local comfort food. Spice lovers and food aficionados looking to add zest to their food adventure should venture into the ethnic enclave of Little India, and sample the fish head curry at Muthu’s Curry. This local staple is made with a unique recipe, concocted by the establishment’s founder Mr. Muthu, and which remains in his sons’ safekeeping to this day. For a feast of diverse tastes, be sure to check out the many hawker delights at Chinatown Complex.

While there’s certainly a wealth of traditional local eateries in Singapore, the city’s chefs are no strangers to invention. Pay a visit to these establishments, and get a taste of how local flavours, techniques and ingredients merge into bold new tastes and forms. Corner House has reopened with a daringly, original new menu that showcases modern French-Asian interpretations by Chef David Thien, who has taken the helm of the one-Michelin-star restaurant since March 2020. Born and raised in Bordeaux, Chef David Thien brings French-Asian touches and interpretations to the table from his journey working through some of the most hallowed Michelin-starred kitchens around Europe. Dubbed “French-Asian cuisine without shackles”, the concept at Corner House showcases intimate sessions where Thien prepares dishes inspired by personal stories, thoughts and memories. For a playful take on Singapore’s traditional cuisine, head to Labyrinth and lose yourself in the complex flavours it presents. The domain of chef-owner Han Li Guang, this Michelin-starred restaurant has a new menu that fuses much-loved local flavours in whimsical modern ways, exemplified in dishes like rojak (a sweet and savoury salad of vegetables, fruits and dough fritters) made from edible garden herbs, stingless bee honey and soy bean curd made with bird’s nest. Labyrinth’s menu is a testament to chef Li Guang’s love for Singaporean produce, with 80% of the ingredients used in the restaurant’s dishes sourced from local farms, gardens and seas.

33,seletar-aerospace-park,Seletar Aerospace Park: a hidden dining oasis,"Experience a slice of Singapore’s colonial past when you dine at Seletar Aerospace Park (SAP). In 1923, the British developed this area to house a Royal Air Force (RAF) station that served Singapore from 1928 to 1971. To house RAF personnel and their families, numerous black and white bungalows were built with the help of Samsui women (female Chinese immigrants who took on construction jobs), who were also known to the British as “Concrete Lizzies”. Today, Seletar Airport operates as a general aviation airport for chartered flights and training purposes. Of the former colonial houses, 32 have been slated for conservation and redevelopment as part of The Oval at Seletar Aerospace Park. This lifestyle enclave plays host to bazaars and carnivals, with  conserved bungalows housing restaurants, spas and shops. Hampstead Wetlands Park—a rustic haven of flora and fauna located in the middle of the enclave— makes for a great spot to explore after a satisfying meal. Take a stroll around this beautiful locale, and discover a range of iconic restaurants, selling everything from European fare to traditional Teochew dishes. The Summerhouse. ‘Farms’-to-table dining. The Summerhouse is one of those places you’ll have no problem spending the entire day at. The space is home to both Wildseed— a casual café and bar— and The Summerhouse Dining Room, the main restaurant perched on the second floor of the conserved colonial bungalow. The dishes at The Summerhouse follow a ‘farms’-to-table approach: produce is sourced from Singaporean and Malaysian farms, and garnishes are plucked from the on-site garden. For a taste of everything The Summerhouse has to offer, order sharing plates for you and your party to enjoy together. If it’s brunch you are looking for, hit Wildseed for hearty gourmet sandwiches and cakes with a local twist. The blue pea flower coconut muffin, a naturally dyed muffin with a desiccated coconut centre, is another must-have for its nod to local flavours. Alternatively, partake in dinner under the stars at the Garden Domes, which boasts enclosures set amidst lush greenery and romantic fairy lights.

Its sister outlet in Balestier, Wheeler’s Yard, is popular among local Instagrammers for its décor, but this branch is not to be outdone. Snap a picture next to the cute silver camper van or under the fairy lights in the evenings. With firewood lining the exterior of the two-storey colonial bungalow, Wheeler’s Estate feels like a luxe campsite in the middle of the great outdoors. On the first floor is The Lawn, a café where diners can grab mats and a basket of snacks for a picnic out on the field, and the Grill House, a separate spot for charcoal-grilled meats and burgers. Head upstairs to The Verandah and be treated to Australian fare in a gorgeous minimalist setting. A nine-metre-long bar dominates one end of the room, with bottles of whisky glowing behind the counter. Try the Tequila and Lime Pork Spare Ribs, which are slow-cooked for 18 hours and basted in zestful tequila sauce. Wheeler’s Estate. 2 Park Lane, Singapore 798386. +65 6262 0001.

The interiors reflect old-world European charm, with plush sofas and wood accents that create a cosy dining space—perfect for a romantic night away from the city. YOUNGS offers brunch, lunch sets, afternoon tea and dinner to satisfy all cravings. The menu is inspired by the owner’s trips to the colourful cities of Europe, featuring dishes like French-style mussel pots, lobster alfredo and buttermilk chicken schnitzel.

For the uninitiated, Teochew food originates from the Chaoshan region of China, east of the Guangdong province. As the region is located by the sea, a typical Teochew meal tends to include dishes like cold crab , braised abalone and sea cucumber. Di Wei Teo Chew Restaurant serves these classics and more, relying on the expertise of head chef Khoo Tai Guan, who ran the restaurant’s first outlet in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It has come a long way from its humble beginnings as a small food court kiosk; the outlet at The Oval houses 13 tables, making it ideal for family gatherings over authentic Teochew delicacies. Chef Khoo’s 30-odd years of experience in cooking Teochew cuisine is evident in his renditions of iconic dishes, such as braised duck and beancurd, prawn balls, and Teochew-style steamed pomfret. The variety here is certainly in no short supply, so brace yourself for a gastronomic treat. Di Wei Teo Chew Restaurant. 1 The Oval, Singapore 797859. +65 6262 5946.  Daily 11.30am-2.30pm, 5.30-10pm.

41,uncovering-eurasian-cuisine-in-singapore,Explore Eurasian cuisine in Singapore,"Eurasian communities in the Malayan Peninsula sprung from Portuguese and Malayan intermarriages, whose descendants would go on to intermarry  migrants of other Asian and European ethnicities. The Eurasians of modern Singapore pride themselves on many popular stews, curries and mince recipes, sporting Western influences from England and Portugal, as well as Asian influences from India and Malaya. Eurasian cuisine pays testament to this rich cultural diversity, sporting influences from both the East and the West. Eurasian cuisine in Singapore boasts myriad popular stews, curries and mince recipes, as well as dishes like vindaloo (spicy meat curry) and mee siam (vermicelli in spicy and sour gravy). The former is a curry that was brought to Malay by British colonisers of India. The Eurasian rendition featuring a strong blend of ginger, garlic, onions, coriander and vinegar to enhance the spicy and savoury nuances of the dish. The latter is a dry noodle dish prepared with garlic, blended chilli, fermented yellow soy bean paste, tamarind, chicken stock and blended dried prawns. The flagship delicacy of the Eurasians—the devil’s curry or curry debal, is a spicy curry flavoured with candlenuts and vinegar. Originally made from Christmas leftovers like ham and sausages, it accompanies these savoury tastes with gingery and tangy flavours that arise from its blend of onions, lemongrass, turmeric, candlenut and galangal. These dishes take hours to prepare and a lifetime to perfect. While eateries dedicated to Eurasian food are no longer as common, you can still find hidden gems about town that hew to this age-old culinary tradition. Read on to discover a taste of history.

Learn how death and the afterlife are viewed and interpreted across religions, cultures, and the ages at the Hell’s Museum. Photo by Choo Yut Shing. One of the oldest existing cultures in the world today, Chinese history stretches back across millennia, and is filled with fascinating stories. History buffs looking to journey through the richness of Chinese tradition and religious beliefs should pay a visit to Haw Par Villa, an Asian cultural park that’s a repository of folklore and storied myths. The origins of Haw Par Villa. Located on a hill in Pasir Panjang, Haw Par Villa was once known as Tiger Balm Gardens. Lovingly built by Myanmar-born businessman Aw Boon Haw for his brother, Aw Boon Par, the park was named after the Tiger Balm medical ointment that the siblings’ father had created. Following its construction in 1937, the grounds of the villa were opened to the public, reflecting Boon Haw’s deep passion for Chinese culture and mythology. Boon Haw personally supervised the artisans who created many of the parks original fixtures, in the hope that the park’s depiction of traditional virtues would provide moral guidance to the public. When war broke out, the Aw family fled Singapore for Yangon (then known as Rangoon). The park was used as an observation point by the Japanese army, and it was only in the post-war years that Aw Boon Haw returned to Singapore, and began to rebuild the park. From the 1940s to the 1970s, many members of the Aw family contributed to the park’s development. This included Boon Par’s son, Aw Cheng Chye, who made various additions to the park’s dioramas. His passion for travel led to the establishment of the park’s International Corners, which pay tribute to the cultures of the many countries he visited. The space began to take its modern form in 1985, when the Singapore Tourism Board took over the management of the grounds, and began revitalisation work on the space. The park’s dynamic evolution continues to this current day. Otherworldly experiences. Haw Par Villa is famous for its vivid depictions of the Ten Courts of Hell from Chinese folklore. Many Singaporeans will cheekily reminisce about being brought there as children by their parents, to learn about the exacting nature of traditional Chinese morality. Besides its trademark attraction, the cultural park is home to over 1,000 statues and 150 dioramas, depicting surreal scenes from legendary works of Chinese literature such as Journey To The West, Madame White Snake, and the stories of the Eight Immortals. Following a nine-month closure for upgrading works, the park reopened in 2021, with enhanced night lighting and extensive conservation work on its iconic statues. The park’s most iconic attraction—The 10 Courts of Hell— is now part of Hell’s Museum. Sprawled across 3,800 square metres, the latter is brand new space that offer brave the chance to delve into global beliefs and traditions about death and the afterlife.

This distinctive landmark in the heart of Little India has fascinating stories to tell of colonial Singapore. Early pioneers. Photo by Jacob Johan. From its earliest days, it was linked with early migrant workers from India, who would have worshipped the goddess to feel safe in a new foreign land. One of its first names was Soonambu Kambam Kovil, or the “temple at the lime village” in Tamil. Many Indians who prayed at the temple worked in lime kilns in the area. During the Japanese air raids in World War II, many people sought physical refuge at the temple as well as prayed for Kali’s protection. As luck—or fate—would have it, the temple and all its statues escaped the bombings unscathed. A spectacular experience. In the 1980s, major reconstruction work took place, with a gopuram (front tower) added as well as eight main domes and several minor ones. The annexe building was also built at the back of the temple. It was again renovated in 1999, with the temple’s consecration ceremony taking place in 2000. In June 2014, the temple had another consecration ceremony which marked the culmination of the major restoration works, as well as the construction of a new six-storey building with various new facilities including a wedding hall, multipurpose hall and staff quarters. With its colourful and intricate statues and detailing, the temple remains one of the most spectacular places of worship in Singapore.

The Michelin-starred chef believes that food is ultimately a bridge for human connection. 1. Little India. A taste of aromatic briyani (an Indian spiced rice dish with meat or vegetables) at Tekka Centre is a fitting (and filling) way to start the day, and you’ll get to experience an environment where Singaporeans of different ethnicities come together. The meat [in the briyani] is tender and so flavourful,” Malcolm enthuses. “It’s one big pot of chicken, mutton and spices. It’s very, very good.” Yakader may be Malcolm’s favourite pick when it comes to briyani, but the food centre is also home to vendors that serve up piping hot tandoor bread (bread cooked in a clay oven), rava dosa (an Indian pancake made from fermented butter) and appam (pancake made with rice batter and coconut milk). While here, stock up on local spices and produce at Tekka Market, housed in the same complex.

Katong Laksa. Start the day with a taste of Peranakan cuisine. A steaming bowl of Katong Laksa is a “perfect introduction to laksa (spicy, coconut milk-based noodle soup)”, says Malcolm.

Since 1953, this nonya establishment has been serving up Straits Chinese favourites like babi pongteh (stewed pork with fermented soya bean), otak otak (grilled fish cake) and sambal udang (chilli shrimp). “I quite like their traditional dishes—reminds me of grandma’s cooking, which brings back a lot of memories for me,” Malcolm shares. 7. Geylang Serai. Save some time and space for Geylang Serai Market. This is where you can explore the Malay culinary influences on traditional Peranakan food. “Peranakan dishes are very similar to Malay cuisine,” Malcolm informs. “Geylang Serai market has everything you need to cook Malay food, from fresh seafood and spices to coconut milk: whatever you want, you want you can probably get there.” As seafood will be tricky to transport, eat at the hawker centre instead.

Order a variety of comfort food from Malcolm’s childhood days: “The hawker centre has many Malay stores selling a variety of dishes. Rice, curry and sambal (spicy chilli paste) is the way to go.”. 8. Singapore Zoo. You’ll want to spend most of your morning (and probably a good portion of the afternoon) exploring the Singapore Zoo, home to more than 2,800 animals from over 300 different species, and one of the first zoos in the world to pioneer open exhibits for the wildlife on display. The ‘Rainforest Zoo’ is one of Malcolm’s favourite places to unwind from his labour of love in the kitchen: “I really love nature and animals, and the zoo has been done up in a really nice way.”. 9. Ang Mo Kio. From one park to another: when Malcolm needs a quiet space to unwind, he visits Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, one of over 300 parks that dot Singapore, and where both natural and urban landscapes coexist in harmony. “I have good memories of cycling here. It’s also nice to be able to come here to relax and reflect,” he says of the 62-hectare green space. There are many serene spots to watch families (otters included) take their evening strolls. End the day indulging in Singaporeans’ second nature—eating: pay a visit to the hawker centre at Ang Mo Kio Street 61, Block 628A where you can partake in a smorgasbord of local dinner options. “The hawker centre at Ang Mo Kio Street 61 is a real hidden find” Malcolm shares. “The braised duck rice and the chicken rice are really good.”.

98,shopping-consumer-advisory,Singapore Consumer Protection Advisory,"Here’s a list of smart shopping tips to ensure an ideal shopping experience in Singapore. Make the most out of your shopping in Singapore with our Consumer Advisory information. While Singapore retailers have fair business practices, there are a small number of shops and restaurants that might make your shopping experience less than ideal. Here are some smart shopping tips to ensure that your retail experience is a pleasant one. 1. Price Research and Comparison. Prices may vary between shops, as distributors are not obliged to abide by each product’s Recommended Retail Price (RRP). While you can expect almost all local major departmental stores to clearly display the prices of their goods, be sure to compare prices of the product or service between shops before purchasing. Be sure to look out for the price tag on the item. If you’ve agreed on a price with the retailer, request to have it written on the invoice before making payment. Research on information such as product model and features, accessories as well as product warranty (including the extent of geographical coverage) beforehand. 2. Note that purchases made are usually final. In Singapore, retailers may enforce strict policies of return, exchange and/or refund the moment payment is made. Always ask your retailer about their store’s policies before making payment for your purchase. You can also request that the retailer indicate their return, exchange and/or refund policy on their invoice. 3. Check receipts or invoices for accuracy. It’s always handy to obtain and keep your purchase receipt, in the event you require an exchange or refund on your items. Check that prices and item descriptions on the receipt or invoice are correct to ensure that you do not pay more than what is required. Make sure that you test the items you wish to purchase to ensure that they operate as they should. Check that the promised accessories, peripherals and free gifts—if any—are included in the package. It’s also good practice to pay only when the price is finalised and your purchase is ready to be handed to you. In circumstances where price of goods are quoted by weight, such as seafood and fruits, request for the final price and weight to be confirmed in writing before finalising an order or purchase. This greatly reduces the chances of miscommunication that may result in a bill that is larger than expected. 4. Verify what your ‘international warranty’ covers. International warranties are not standardised, and you should always ask and verify that your warranty is valid in your home country. Ensure that both your invoice and warranty card bear your retailer’s stamp and signature. In the case of electronic goods, note down the product’s serial number as well. For additional assistance or to flag inappropriate retailer behaviour, call Touristline at 1800 736 2000 (toll-free in Singapore), or (65) 6736 2000 (from overseas). Touristline operates from Mondays to Fridays (excluding Public Holidays), 9am to 6pm.

101,civic-district-art-trail,Civic District Art Trail: Days of Yore,"Travel back into the colonial era on the Civic District Art Trail, and learn about some of Singapore’s significant monuments and memorials. Discover how traditional spaces take on new meaning when you visit The Arts House at The Old Parliament. This former seat of power is now home to a multitude of art, performance and literary events. One of a series of statues named The People of The River, this sculpture along Cavenagh Bridge exudes a whimsical scene of play, hearkening back to Singapore’s early days. A peek into Singapore’s heritage through art. If you’re interested to know more about the country’s history and its art, this is the guide for you. The Civic District Art Trail dives into the heart of the city’s past, with monuments commemorating prominent historical figures such as Sir Stamford Raffles, historical monuments and architectural icons of the 21st century. You’ll also get to admire the works of some of Singapore’s pioneering sculptors, as well as modern pieces by artists from around the globe. Dhoby Ghaut MRT station to the National Museum of Singapore. Alight at Dhoby Ghaut MRT station and head towards the National Museum of Singapore. On your walk, you’ll come to an angular structure on a grassy patch just in front of the YMCA of Singapore, at the corner of Prinsep Street and Orchard Road. This is 1 Endless Flow (1980), the second public sculpture by Singaporean artist Tan Teng Kee. Commissioned by OCBC Bank, this 6.4-metre-high brass sculpture was originally installed outside the OCBC Centre on Chulia Street. After the bank donated it to the Parks and Recreation Department in 1983, it was moved to Bras Basah Park and later to its current location. When you get to the National Museum of Singapore, you’ll notice 2 20 Tonnes (2002) by Singaporean sculptor Han Sai Por–six rough, ridged granite slabs lined up in a row. Another of Han’s artworks is 3 Seeds (2006), two giant brown kernels carved from sandstone excavated from Fort Canning Park while the museum was being developed. Towards the left, you’ll see 4 Living World (1987), four colourful bronze figures by Taiwanese sculptor Ju Ming for the centennial celebrations of the then Singapore National Museum. At the side sits the spiky, twisting stainless steel sculpture, 5 Transformation (2004) by famed sculptor Tan Teng Kee. Just a few steps outside the National Museum is 6 Let There Be Peace (2005) by Alexandra Nechita from Romania, a three-metre-tall bronze United Nations Peace Monument for Asia. Walk towards the museum's back entrance. Here, you’ll see 7 Pedas Pedas (2006) by Singaporean artist Kumari Nahappan. The title means ‘spicy’ in Malay, and this giant chilli pepper sculpture symbolises Singapore’s rich blend of cultures. ASEAN Sculpture Garden. Crossing the road from the National Museum of Singapore at Fort Canning Link, you’ll get to Fort Canning Park. Walk past the carpark and you’ll get to the ASEAN Sculpture Garden. The outdoor artworks at this quiet spot were created in 1981 for the ASEAN Sculptures Symposium in Singapore. Each of the five founding member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations–the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore–donated a sculpture to this garden within a park. In 1988, Brunei contributed its piece when it became an ASEAN member. The bold, red 8 Augury (1988) by Malaysian Anthony Lau was a replacement after the original fibreglass sculpture Taming Sari by Ariffin Mohammed Ismail could not withstand the weather. Known as the grandfather of Singapore sculpture, Ng Eng Teng created the minimalist 9 Balance (1982), which was commissioned by the Committee on Culture and Information. 10 Concentration (1982), by Vichai Sithiratn from Thailand, is made up of steel plates while 11 Unity (1982) by Indonesian sculptor But Muchtar is made of copper and steel. The flagpole-like, stainless steel 12 Together (1988) is by Brunei’s Osman Bin Mohammad and symbolises the six members of ASEAN at the time. Finally, the five-metre-tall steel-and-concrete 13 Fredesvinda (1982) by Napoleon Veloso Abueva from the Philippines resembles the skeleton of an unfinished boat. The title means ‘strength of the country’ in German. City Hall MRT Station to The Arts House. Take the train from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station and alight at City Hall MRT station. This is the heart of Singapore’s Civic District, with its many historic buildings. Walk to the magnificent Old Supreme Court along St Andrew’s Road. This building is now a part of the National Gallery Singapore. You can still glimpse the 14 Allegory of Justice (1937) if you look up towards its roof. Representing a system where law and order prevail–with the figures of Justice, Mercy, the Law, Gratitude and Prosperity–this imposing piece was carved by Italian sculptor Cavalieri Rudolfo Nolli, who also worked on the new throne building for King Chulalongkorn of Siam in 1913. Cross the street to Victoria Theatre. This is where you will see the likeness of the man who started it all, 15 Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore. This is the original statue in blackened bronze, which was sculpted by Thomas Woolner in 1887, and its nickname orang besi means ‘iron man’ in Malay. It was originally installed on Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee Day on 27 June 1887 at the Padang but was moved to its current location during Singapore’s Centenary Celebrations on 6 February 1919. A short stroll away to The Arts House, formerly the old Parliament House, you’ll see the bronze 16 Elephant Statue. It was a gift by King Chulalongkorn to mark his 1871 visit. On its high pedestal, the monument’s inscription in Siamese, Jawi, Chinese, and English reads: “His Majesty Somdetch Paramindr Maha Chulalongkorn, the Supreme King of Siam, landed at Singapore, the first foreign land visited by a Siamese Monarch, on the 16th March, 1871.”.

102,unique-street-art-trail-in-chinatown,Discover Chinatown's iconic street art,"Hunt for inspiration amidst the quaint shophouses of Chinatown, with our guide to the district’s colourful street art. Looking to spruce up your Instagram feed while learning about Singapore’s past? These charming murals by Yip Yew Chong give you the perfect opportunity to snap a selfie. More than just depictions of the past, Yip Yew Chong’s murals are a window into Singapore’s yesteryears, and his passion for painting has garnered him much-deserved attention. Overview. Discover how art comes alive in Chinatown—around the corners of lively eateries and quaint boutiques, you’ll find ample opportunities to snap Instagram-worthy shots of gorgeous murals, depicting Singapore’s past and present. Spend at least half a day exploring this bustling district, and get ready to feast your senses on beautiful art, cultural landmarks, and delicious food. Lantern Festival by Yip Yew Chong. Your visual adventure begins just outside Chinatown Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Station. From Exit A, head to the small lane near the Temple Street taxi stand, and across from 1 Mei Heong Yuen Dessert. You can’t miss this mural—a colourful depiction of how Singapore celebrates the Mid-Autumn Festival, a traditional harvest festival that takes place in September to early October. The artist, Yip Yew Chong, is a prominent member of Singapore’s street art scene, whose works focuses predominantly on nostalgia and our city’s rich cultural heritage. Iconic Lanterns and Shophouses of Chinatown. Continue on to 2 Pagoda Street for a gorgeous photo beneath Chinatown’s iconic lanterns. The distinctive row of heritage shophouses here are hard to miss, with vibrant colours and architecture hearkening back to Singapore’s early days. While these houses are a blast from the past, they also possess charmingly contemporary design elements—notice the bright yellow flowers painted on the blue shophouse. My Chinatown Home by Yip Yew Chong. Walk over to 3 30 Smith Street, and you’ll get a glimpse into a humble shophouse from Singapore’s yesteryears. It’s also a fantastic photo opportunity—from the front, you can almost insert yourself into the scene. This snapshot of Singapore’s earlier days taps on the artist’s memories of his childhood, depicting a familial scene from a traditional Chinese home that exudes warmth and nostalgia. A stone’s throw away from this immersive mural is the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum, a truly majestic sight with architecture influenced by China’s Tang Dynasty. This place of worship occasionally holds classes on meditation and Buddhist traditions, making it a must-visit for the budding scholar of world religions. Letter Writer by Yip Yew Chong. As you pass by 4 North Bridge Centre  you’ll find a letter writer working hard at his desk, complete with calligraphy tools and freshly-inked couplets hanging to dry. Drawn based on his experiences of watching these scribes hard at work, Yip Yew Chong has immortalised a scene that’s shaped the Singapore of today. The letter writer depicted in this mural was an integral member of Singapore’s historical community—individuals like him often provided the only form of communication between Singapore’s Chinese migrants and their families in China. It’s a far cry from the modern-day connectivity that we now experience, and may well inspire you to share some shots of this nostalgic piece with your family and loved ones. Mural of Bruce Lee by School of Design. Bruce Lee makes an appearance along the walls of 5 Chinatown Complex, holding the iconic durian, no less. Painted by students from the School of Design at Temasek Polytechnic, this cheeky mural enlivens the area with quirky elements that have come to be commonly associated with Singapore’s culture, including the aforementioned king of fruit. Other local touches include an Oriental dragon, curry puffs, and even an ‘I love Singapore’ singlet. Hipster Murals by Ripple Root. These abstract murals along 6 Keong Saik Road are a perfect complement to the chic cafes and working spaces in the vicinity. The piece is painted by local art duo Ripple Root, whose works are inspired by wildlife and naturalistic imagery. The splashes of paint are inspired by Peranakan* tiles, enlivening the white walls with vibrant colours. If you’re looking to snap an ‘Outfit of the Day’ (OOTD) shot, this makes for an apt background. After you’re done, beat the heat with a milkshake or a frozen custard from Shake Shack, and chow down on one of their iconic burgers. *The term is an Indonesian/Malay word that means “local born”, which generally refers to people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage. Botanical Mural by Ripple Root. The nearby 7 Clan Cafe houses another quirky project by Ripple Root—a swirling botanical mural that perfectly suits the eatery’s focus on clean eating and aromatic teas. If you’re parched from all the exploring, be sure to head inside for a tipple and brunch favourites like truffle fries and croissants. Alternatively, the nearby rooftop bar at Potato Head offers cocktails and chill tunes, and is a popular weekend hangout. Thian Hock Keng Temple Mural by Yip Yew Chong. Along the back wall of this ornate temple, you’ll find another creation by Yip Yew Chong. This sprawling, 40-metre-long mural is a moving testament to the lives of our nation’s early Hokkien (a dialect group from south-eastern Fujian in China) immigrants, whose sacrifices greatly shaped modern Singapore. Take some time to deepen your appreciation of Chinese architecture at 8 Thian Hock Keng Temple. This eminent place of worship was built in 1839, and not a single nail was used in its construction. Within the temple, you’ll find shrines to deities and prominent figures from Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism and traditional ancestor worship, making it a great way to learn about the diversity of Chinese spiritual beliefs. Assorted Murals by Anglo Chinese Schools and CENO2. If you’re feeling peckish, be sure to venture inside 9 Amoy Street Food Centre and discover Singapore’s delicious hawker fare, before continuing on your hunt for inspiration. Themed ‘Then & Now’, this whimsical set of paintings is a vibrant tribute by students and staff from Singapore’s Anglo Chinese (ACS) Schools. The schools’ history is indelibly entwined with the Chinatown neighbourhood, with the first of its campuses being established in the vicinity in 1886. One of the most striking pieces you’ll find here is a five-wall composition showcasing the old ACS shophouse, a Samsui woman, traditional hawkers, and other varied renderings of Singapore’s past. Old Trades by Yip Yew Chong. Round off your adventure at 10 Mohammed Ali Lane, where you’ll spot another snapshot of history—a quirky scene of Singapore’s street vendors from our early years of independence in the 1960s. To gain insights into our city’s yesteryears, observe the detailed renderings of old-school goodies in the Mamak Store (provisions stall). A few steps away, a craftsman presents an amusing assortment of masks and toys, while Samsui women (female migrant workers from Sansui District, China, known for their iconic red headscarves) watch from the sidewalk. Across the road, you’ll find Sri Mariamman Temple, Singapore’s oldest Hindu temple. Acquaint yourself with this millennia-old religion—the temple’s majestic gopuram (grand tower entrance) and the elaborate shrines of the establishment’s interior make for great photo opportunities.

103,in-the-neighbourhood-chinatown,In The Neighbourhood: Chinatown,"Chinatown’s cultural splendours, hip lifestyle establishments and age-old places of worship make it worth spending a full day here. House within the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple’s impressive façade are centuries-old relics and exhibits that tell the story of Buddhist history. Home to both tradition and modernity, the bustling district of Chinatown comes alive at night. Chinatown. Besides being an ethnic enclave for Singapore’s early Chinese settlers, Chinatown has transformed into the country’s largest heritage precinct—filled with an exciting meld of hip haunts, cultural treasures and architectural gems. Encompassing Kreta Ayer, Telok Ayer, Tanjong Pagar and Bukit Pasoh, Chinatown’s four sub-districts each possess their own unique charms. While Chinatown’s size might seem daunting for the first-time visitor, this comprehensive guide will ensure you don’t miss out any of its star attractions. 1. Chinatown Heritage Centre. A gateway into Singapore’s yesteryears, make the perfect starting point of your voyage discovery at the 1 Chinatown Heritage Centre. Learn about the lives of Chinatown’s inhabitants through the establishment’s six galleries of interactive exhibits, which include olfactory displays of opium and spices, immersive streetscapes and homages to its current notable residents. If you’re looking for a guided tour, you can explore Chinatown’s rich culture with ‘Red Clogs Down The Five Foot Way’. Helmed by the master storytellers from Journeys Pte Ltd, this tour will have you exploring traditional Chinese trades, discovering beautifully-conserved shophouses and learning about the lives of the district’s early denizens. Note: Chinatown Heritage Centre is closed for renovation and enhancement works. 2. Sri Mariamman Temple. Built almost two centuries ago, 2 Sri Mariamman Temple, Singapore’s oldest Hindu temple, remains a thriving place of worship to this day. Marvel at the majestic, six-tiered gopuram (grand tower), and then head inside to explore further. The statue of the temple’s patron goddess is only unveiled during special occasions, but you’ll be able to admire the site’s murals and shrines, dedicated to the Hindu deities Durga, Ganesh and Shiva. 3. Masjid Jamae. Discover Chinatown’s religious diversity as you make your way down the stretch of South Bridge Road, and observe the distinctive octagonal minarets of 3 Masjid Jamae. Also known to locals as Chulia Palli (Chulia Mosque), this age-old religious establishment was established by Tamil Muslims from the Coromandel Coast between 1830 to 1835. Its architecture can be traced back to the 19th century, and fuses elements from both Neoclassical and South Indian tradition. 4. Mohamed Ali Lane Murals. Make a detour down 4 Mohammed Ali Lane, and encounter art unbound from galleries. Painted by Yip Yew Chong—one of Singapore’s many bold street artists—these Instagrammable murals depict nostalgic scenes from our city’s past. Puppeteers, lion dance costume makers and other nostalgic figures are immortalised on this quiet street, and provide a glimpse into the Lion City’s past. 5. Tong Heng. For a taste of tradition, grab a sweet treat or two for the road at 5 Tong Heng. This century-old Cantonese confectionary is famous for its egg tarts, but you should also sample their red bean paste pastries and lao po bing (pastry made with winter melon, almond paste and sesame). 6. Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum. The 6 Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum's distinctive Tang Dynasty-inspired architecture makes it easy to spot as you stroll down South Bridge Road. Both a museum and a place of worship, visitors are free to explore the temple’s repository of relics and cultural artefacts. We recommend taking a quick breather at the temple’s tranquil rooftop garden, with its distinctive pagoda and prayer wheel. Ed’s note: Visits to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple are limited to groups of 5. Visit the temple’s website to stay updated on the latest COVID-19 safety measures. 7. Sago Street. Named for the sago flour factories that dotted the area in the 1840s, 7 Sago Street is now home to traditional Chinese apothecaries, unpretentious eateries and souvenir stalls. For toothsome pastries and delightful mooncakes, be sure to swing by Tai Chong Kok—This old-school bakery has been in operation since 1935. 8. Souvenir Shopping. You’ll find plenty of knick-knacks and memorable mementos by browsing the wares of the pushcart vendors along Sago Street and its immediate vicinity. We personally recommend visiting 8 On Cheong Jewellery along Smith Street for a contemporary take on jade jewellery, Thye Shan Medical Hall on New Bridge Road for Traditional Chinese Medicine and Lim Chee Guan for the sweet and savoury-tasting bak kwa (barbecued meat slices). 9. Chinatown Visitor Centre. If you’re still feeling disoriented by the district’s hustle and bustle, you can get all the info you need at the 9 Chinatown Visitor Centre. These visitor centres can be found all across Singapore, and offer a range of walking tours, souvenirs and tickets to island-wide attractions. Note: Chinatown Visitor Centre is temporarily closed. 10. Nanyang Old Coffee. Peckish and thirsty from all that walking? Be sure to drop by 10 Nanyang Old Coffee for an aromatic cup of traditional coffee and kaya (coconut jam) toast, with soft-boiled eggs on the side.  If you’re keen to learn more about our local foodie culture, the café also holds coffee-themed workshops on the first and third Sunday of every month. 11. Chinatown Complex. Alternatively, make a pit stop for lunch at the island’s largest hawker centre. While you won’t find food vendors touting their dishes along Singapore’s busy street these days, their legacy lives on at 11 Chinatown Complex. Savour sa kae ma (honey crackers) at Pan Ji Cooked Food and knock back a pint of craft beer at Smith Street Taps. For lunch, indulge in the claypot rice from Lian He Ben Ji Claypot, or the beloved dishes from Liao Fan Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle. 12. Nam’s Supplies. Make 12 Nam’s Supplies your next destination, and gain insight into the religious customs of Singapore’s Chinese community. The establishment stocks a range of paper effigies, incense oil and other offerings used during religious ceremonies to commemorate and show respect to the dearly departed. 13. Thian Hock Keng Temple. One of Singapore’s oldest and most venerated Hokkien temples, 13 Thian Hock Keng Temple's patron deity—Mazu—was said to have watched over the 19th-century Chinese immigrants who made their ways across the seas. Before the land was reclaimed, it used to stand on the shoreline of Telok Ayer Basin. Venture inside, and marvel at the ingenuity of traditional Chinese carpentry; the space was built without a single nail being used during its construction. 14. My Awesome Café. Talk about putting the ‘hospital’ in hospitality—formerly the home of a decades-old medical establishment known as the Chung Hwa Free Clinic, this historical space has been revitalised by 14 My Awesome Cafe. This trendy eatery serves up all-day breakfast platters, hearty sandwiches and healthy salads amidst industrial-chic surroundings. Be sure to grab some merchandise on your way out, and snap an Instagram photo to commemorate your time in Chinatown. Afterwards, spend the night winding down at any of the watering holes at Keong Saik or Ann Siang, or tuck into some Michelin-starred nosh in the area.

Having been in the works since the 1970s, the Esplanade was set up as a hub where Singaporeans can engage with and be inspired by the local arts and culture scene. Since opening its doors in 2002, the Esplanade has revolutionised the Arts in Singapore and grown into a bustling hub for shopping, dining and entertainment.

The Merlion, built by local craftsman Lim Nang Seng, was unveiled on 15 September 1972 by then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.

108,shophouses-typology,Shophouses,"Heritage gems. With many beautifully preserved examples on hand today, the shophouses in Singapore are prime examples of timeless architectural appeal. The varying styles of Singapore’s shophouses are a showcase of our evolving architecture. These charming shophouses in the Joo Chiat/Katong neighbourhood are prime examples of timeless architectural appeal. Koon Seng Road is home to houses that display architectural styles from Peranakan to Southern Chinese. One of the most popular forms of local architecture must be the shophouse—rows of charming narrow units that speak to us of Asian heritage and culture more strongly than virtually any other structure. A blend of different styles. Traditionally, a shophouse has a narrow frontage with a sheltered corridor at the front for pedestrians (called a five-foot way). They have internal courtyards, open stairwells and skylights to bring light and air into otherwise dark and narrow interiors. Shophouses here display different architectural influences, often depending on when they were built. Several periods have been identified when it comes to shophouse architecture. There is the minimalist approach, taken in the Early Style with little to no ornamentation, the austere elegance of the Second Transitional Style and the streamlined modernity of the Art Deco period, which eschewed rich detailing and tiling for sleek columns and arches instead. A brilliant mix of cultural influences. It is the Late Style that is the most head-turning, with its bold use of colour and fancy tiles, as well as the eclectic mix of Chinese, Malay and European elements. Think of Chinese porcelain-chip friezes and bat-wing shaped air vents co-existing with Malay timber fretwork, French windows, Portuguese shutters and Corinthian pilasters. The neighbourhoods of Clarke Quay, Joo Chiat/Katong, Chinatown, and Emerald Hill, just to name a few, boast many fine examples of the shophouses described above.

Majestic supertrees at Gardens by the Bay. Gardens by the Bay’s cool and misty Cloud Forest Dome contains a 30-metre-tall indoor waterfall and stunning views. Gardens by the Bay’s sprawling 101-hectare lot makes a stunning addition to the Marina Bay skyline. It’s hard to miss the sprawling 101-hectare lot right by the water in Marina Bay. Two huge futuristic structures rise out of the greenery at Gardens by the Bay, which was designed with environmental sustainability in mind. These are the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest cooled conservatories, which was listed in the 2015 Guinness World Records as the world’s largest glass greenhouse. The freestanding unsupported glass roofs enclose expansive spaces, unmarred by any pillar or column. Besides ultra-modern design, the conservatories also use cutting-edge technologies for better energy efficiency. Cool domes. The Flower Dome replicates the cool-dry climate of regions like California and South Africa, and boasts more than 32,000 plants comprising some 160 species, cultivars and varieties. Not to be missed is the cool, misty Cloud Forest Dome, with its 35-metre tall “Cloud Mountain”, covered in orchids, ferns and bromeliads and containing a spectacular 30-metre-tall indoor waterfall. Splendid Supertrees. You’ll recognise the distinctive Supertrees—25 to 50-metre-tall vertical gardens that collect rainwater, generate solar power and act as venting ducts for the park’s conservatories. If you’re in the mood for a spectacular view, take the OCBC Skyway, a 128-metre-long walkway suspended between two Supertrees, for a bird’s eye view of the park.

A feat of engineering, an architectural statement and a sheer aesthetic triumph, Marina Bay Sands® has upped the ante for buildings in Singapore. The breath-taking Marina Bay Sands® is a sheer modern architectural triumph. The stunning Marina Bay Sands® building has put its definitive stamp on the Singapore skyline. Visitors can expect an immersive experience within its sprawling complex. Ever since its stunning silhouette was unveiled in 2010, the mammoth complex of Marina Bay Sands® has dominated the entire Bayfront area, and imprinted its definitive stamp on the Singapore skyline. There’s a ton to explore at this massive, 155,000-square-metre integrated resort, which comprises a hotel, convention centre, theatre, museum, event plaza, celebrity restaurants and shops. Sky Spaces. A marvel of engineering, it’s no surprise that Marina Bay Sands® was featured on an episode of National Geographic’s documentary television series Megastructures. Designed by acclaimed architect Moshe Safdie, the structure captivates the imagination, with its three sloping towers soaring 194 metres from the ground, and linked at the top by the expansive SkyPark®. The park offers visitors 360-degree views of the city’s skyline and contains lush gardens, jogging paths, a public observatory, an infinity swimming pool and the world’s largest public cantilevered space. Museum of Wonder. Other highlights include the ArtScience Museum™, shaped like an unfolding lotus bloom and anchored by a dramatic waterfall. The building’s ‘petals’ rise at different heights, sheathed in a polymer often used for yachts, to achieve a sense of gleaming lightness. A Display of Light. Before your day comes to an end, be sure to catch Spectra—A Light And Water Show, a free-to-public visual extravaganza by Marina Bay Sands®. Spectra—A Light And Water Show chronicles the Singapore story through a mesmerizing 15-minute display of music, water and light.

115,raffles-hotel,Raffles Hotel Singapore,"Hark back to a golden age of elegant refinement and gracious living at Raffles Hotel Singapore, where the past reawakens to glorious life. The iconic Raffles Hotel Singapore has been home to both tall tales and famous folks like Michael Jackson and Queen Elizabeth II. Raffles Hotel Singapore’s neo-Renaissance architecture also features tropical touches like extensive verandahs. Enjoy excellent service from one of the oldest hotels in Singapore. Photo by Raffles Hotel, Singapore. Easily the most famous hotel in Singapore, no other establishment epitomises the island’s colonial history better than Raffles Hotel Singapore. Named after Singapore’s founder, Sir Stamford Raffles, the hotel was built by the Sarkies Brothers, responsible for other luxury hotels in the region during the colonial era. Although Raffles Hotel Singapore opened in 1887, its layout continued to evolve, with hotel wings, suites and other facilities added over the years. Jewel in the crown. Photo by Raffles Hotel, Singapore. However, it was the hotel’s new main building, designed by R. A. J. Bidwell of Swan & MacLaren and completed in 1899, which turned out to be the jewel in the crown. An exemplary showcase of neo-Renaissance architecture, tropical touches like high ceilings and extensive verandahs were added. It boasted a dining room with a marble floor, electric lights and powered ceiling fans—a first for any hotel in the region. It became the place to be. Charlie Chaplin, Queen Elizabeth II and Rudyard Kipling were just some of the illustrious names that spent a night or two under its roof. A facelift in 1989 restored it to the height of its glory. An original cast-iron portico and a timber staircase were reinstated, while decorative plasterwork was painstakingly repaired. All rooms were converted into suites with teakwood floors and handmade carpets. A new lease on life. Today, the Raffles Hotel Singapore is a heritage icon, and its storied elegance, compelling history and colourful guest list continues to draw travellers from around the world. Following restoration works in 2019, the hotel now boasts a whole suite of new amenities and a fresh new look. Undertaken by acclaimed interior designer Alexandra Champalimaud, Singapore’s grand old dame of hotels has been given a new lease of life. Guests can now check in from the comfort of their hotel rooms, and the hotel’s total suite count has been increased from 103 to 115. Iconic restaurants and bars like the Tiffin Room and the Long Bar (home of the Singapore Sling) make their return, joined by new establishments from world-famous chefs. These include Chinese restaurant Yi by Masterchef Jereme Leung, the Mediterranean-themed Osteria BBR by French legend Alain Ducasse and Le Dame Pic by Michelin-awarded chef Anne Sophie Pic. Visitors looking to shop for souvenirs can visit the Raffles Boutique at the refurbished Raffles Hotel Singapore Arcade. Formerly known as the Raffles Gift Shop, the establishment sells a variety of mementos and sovenirs—including Singapore Sling-related souvenirs.

116,marina-barrage,Marina Barrage,"This innovative facility not only supplies water to Singaporeans and helps alleviate floods, but also doubles up as a place for family fun. More than just an ordinary reservoir, the Marina Barrage is an ideal recreational space for families and friends. Besides its functional features, the barrage also serves as a great lifestyle destination with spectacular views of the waterfront and city skyline. The Marina Bridge is a marvel of engineering that allows visitors to walk across the Marina Barrage reservoir. The Marina Barrage is an ideal spot for a dose of education, mixed with fun in the sun and recreation on the water. In Singapore, even something as common as a reservoir can be turned into a hotspot for recreational activities. Built across the mouth of the 350-metre-wide Marina Channel, the Marina Barrage creates the country’s 15th reservoir, with a catchment area that spans a whopping 10,000 hectares. As the water in the reservoir remains calm all year around, it’s ideal for some soaking wet fun, whether it’s kayaking or, for the more team-spirited, a dragon boat race. If water sports is not your thing, head to the rooftop of the barrage, which boasts a green space that’s popular for flying a kite, or just to chill out with the family. The Marina Barrage also plays an important part in helping to alleviate flooding in some of the lower lying areas of the island. During periods of heavy rain, a series of nine crest gates will be opened to release excess storm water into the sea when the tide is low. When the tide is high, seven giant pumps that are capable of pumping one Olympic-sized swimming pool per minute whirr into action, draining water into the sea. Photo by LH Wong via Foter.com. The facility is also a showcase for Singapore’s push to be a greener country. The Solar Park, for instance, features one of the largest collections of solar panels in Singapore, with over 400 panels providing electricity needed for lighting at the barrage during the day. To find out more about the country’s efforts to go green, head to the Sustainable Singapore Gallery at the barrage’s ground floor. This educational space illustrates environmental and water issues through interactive multi-media displays, exhibits and games, with a guided tour available at the gallery.

117,the-interlace,The Interlace,"Stacking the decks. Straddling the domains of art, functionality and architecture, The Interlace is truly a sight to admire. The artful arrangement of The Interlace’s residential blocks makes it an architectural icon. Photo by Choo Yut Shing via Foter.com. As you hike along the green leafy belt that stretches between Kent Ridge, Telok Blangah Hill and Mount Faber Park, you may come across a condominium complex that warrants a second look. The right angles. Each of The Interlace’s 31 apartment blocks are stacked in a seemingly haphazard way, twisting at angles so that they do not form a straight line. The effect is unusual yet pleasing to the eye, with the building’s odd jutting corners providing space for lush roof gardens, sky terraces and large balconies of cascading greenery. Privacy, please. The Interlace was designed by German architect Ole Scheeren, known for conceptualising some of the world’s most head-turning buildings, like the CCTV headquarters in Beijing. Scheeren’s plan was to break away from the usual form of the skyscraper. With The Interlace, he turned the vertical into the horizontal, breaking a building into blocks and rotating them at different angles, such that each block would have privacy and a different view of the vicinity. The hexagonal arrangement ensured that occupants could enjoy a balance between private and public spaces, preserving individuality without detracting from a strong sense of community. Scheeren’s ground breaking vision may yet set a precedent for many other urban spaces, seeking to balance the demands of space and privacy in increasingly dense cities, where both qualities are fast becoming a luxury.

118,old-supreme-court,Old Supreme Court,"Majestic form. From a hall of justice to a gallery of art, the Old Supreme Court underwent an overhaul for its new role as the National Gallery Singapore. The Old Supreme Court’s striking façade makes it a prime landmark to admire if you’re a fan of Neoclassical architecture. The Old Supreme Court’s columns and tympanum were created by a Singapore-based Milanese sculptor. The Old Supreme Court was built during the era of the Great Depression. An architectural icon that dates back to 1939, The Old Supreme Court on St Andrew’s Road has a history longer than modern Singapore. This striking building was given a new lease on life in 2015, when it was repurposed as the National Gallery Singapore. Designed by Frank Dorrington Ward, chief architect of the Straits Settlements Public Works Department, it was the last classical building completed in Singapore and said to be one of Ward’s greatest works. Inspired by the Old Bailey. Photo by Yeowatzup via Foter.com. It is believed that his inspiration came from the Old Bailey Courthouse in London. It is easy to see the similarity, with the central dome backing the classical façade anchored by Corinthian and Ionic columns. The columns and the tympanum (the triangular piece over the columns) are of particular interest, created by Singapore-based Milanese sculptor Cavaliere Rudolfo Nolli and carved out of gypsum plaster. Symbols of law and order. Photo by Choo Yut Shing via Foter.com. The sculptures in the tympanum are dominated by the central figure of Justice. On the left, a figure represents the need for Mercy, while on the right, the Law is depicted by two legislators carrying books. Other figures symbolise Gratitude and Prosperity—the results of a system where law and order prevail.  The building’s austere interior is a reminder that it was built during the Great Depression. Gypsum plaster was used to finish the cornices and the main hall, while the Art Deco flooring was done in rubber, which lent it the added advantage of absorbing loud noises. The exquisite Rotunda Library—in the middle of the building—is particular notable for its detailed workmanship, relief panelling and distinctive cornices.

During the Hari Raya Haji period, the faithful congregate at the mosque dressed in their finest. Hari Raya Haji in Singapore is a celebration that commemorates Prophet Ibrahim's faith in God. Its specific date differs from year to year, based on astronomical calculations. Lasting four days, Hari Raya Haji commemorates Prophet Ibrahim’s (Abraham's) complete faith and trust in God. This is recounted in the story of God commanding Ibrahim to sacrifice his son Ismail (Ishmael), a commandment that Ibrahim responded to with obedience. God stopped him, and provided him with a sheep to substitute as a sacrifice, instead of his son. Prayer and sacrifice. During this period, the faithful dress in their finest clothes and congregate in mosques to listen to sermons and offer their prayers. But the most important ritual observed here is that of 'korban' (sacrifice). Worshippers contribute live sheep, lambs, goats and cows, which are slaughtered by a quick slit to the jugular as prayers are recited. This act reminds worshippers of the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim to offer up even his own flesh and blood to God. The animal is then cleaned and the meat carved up and distributed to worshippers and the needy. Charity and faith. Photo by Public Domain. The tradition is that the person who paid for the animal gets one-third of the meat and one-third goes to family and friends. As this festival is about compassion, sharing wealth and remembering blessings, the last third is usually distributed to the poor and the needy. After this, Muslims pay social visits to parents, families and friends, and relax over a meal together. There is little overt feasting or merrymaking—this is one festival that is more about spiritual needs than physical ones.",https://www.visitsingapore.com/festivals-events-singapore/cultural-festivals/hari-raya-haji/

The Singapore story is well known—how it achieved independence on 9th August 1965 amid severe doubt it could survive at all with its tiny size and the lack of natural resources. Yet the island succeeded against the odds, deftly navigating its way through stormy waters of domestic turmoil, regional strife and international politics. It made use of every single advantage it had, emerging on the world stage as a major commercial hub, financial centre and global player. A parade that truly dazzles. Photo by Choo Yut Shing. And in this way, the national narrative has been shaped over the years, a narrative that is retold in varying ways every year during the National Day Parade.

125,hungry-ghost-festival,Hungry Ghost Festival,"Discover the rich traditions of Singapore’s Chinese population during The Hungry Ghost Festival, which honours the memories of the deceased. The Hungry Ghost Festival is rooted in Buddhist and Taoist culture and happens during the seventh month of the Lunar calendar—take note of the dos and don’ts of the season. A man conducts traditional Hungry Ghost Festival prayers—a common sight on the streets of Chinatown. Just as the Americans have Halloween, the Chinese have the Hungry Ghost Festival (also known as Zhong Yuan Jie in Chinese), a festival held in honour of the dearly departed. According to traditional customs, the souls of the dead are believed to roam the earth during the festival, and these ghosts can get up to mischief if ignored. To prevent this, all sorts of offerings are made during this period, which is the seventh month in the lunar calendar. Making offerings. Notice those dark-coloured metal bins scattered around residential areas and housing estates?. They are specifically provided to contain the stacks of hell money and paper offerings, such as cars, watches and jewellery, that are burned by relatives to appease their deceased family members—taking care of their material needs even in the afterlife. Do watch your step in case you trample on food left out in the open. Although many place their food offerings (oranges, rice or even suckling pig) and joss sticks on proper altars, others tuck them at the side of footpaths or trees. Boisterous shows. And as if satisfying the ghosts’ appetites for money and food wasn’t enough, taking care of their entertainment is also important. A mainstay of the festival is the 'getai' performance, thrown as a popular mode of entertainment for the wandering spirits. Large tents are set up in open fields to host raucous dinners and auctions in heartland estates like Ang Mo Kio and Yishun. There are performances too, such as Chinese operas and 'getai' (literally ‘song stage’ in Chinese, or live stage performances), which feature tales of gods and goddesses, bawdy stand-up comedy, as well as song and dance numbers. 'Getai' today is a very different animal—jazzed up with snazzy LED panel lit stages. Young perfomers sing both traditional songs in dialect and thumping techno versions of English and Mandarin pop ditties. It appears that even the tastes of the spiritual world are moving with the times. Everyone is welcome—so sit back and enjoy the show. Just remember not to sit in the front row, unless you want to rub shoulders with the ‘special guests’.",https://www.visitsingapore.com/festivals-events-singapore/cultural-festivals/hungry-ghost-festival/

141,explore-singapores-islands,Explore Singapore’s islands,"So you’ve shopped till you dropped at Orchard Road, taken your mandatory selfie with the Merlion, and marvelled at the skyscrapers at Marina Bay. Want to see more of Singapore? Head to these offshore islands for a Singaporean experience unlike any other. St John’s Island. Calling all cat lovers, skip the cat cafes and head to St John's Island for some quality time with your favourite furry friends—the island has become famous in recent years for the many friendly felines lounging around. St John’s Island has also seen its fair share of history. What was once a quarantine centre for infectious diseases and later a drug rehabilitation centre, was transformed in 1975. The island was given a new lease of life, as an oasis where travellers enjoy swimming lagoons, beaches, picnic grounds, trekking routes and more. How to get there: Catch a ferry to St John’s Island from Marina South Pier (S$15 for an adult round-trip ticket, S$12 for children). Pulau Ubin. Perhaps the most well-known of Singapore’s offshore islands, Pulau Ubin is the place to be if you’re looking to connect with nature or take a walk on the wild side. Pulau Ubin is home to one of Singapore’s last kampongs (villages), and the island is brimming with rustic charm. Grab your bikes and cycle around the island, or take a van to the Chek Jawa Wetlands, where you can stroll down the kilometre-long boardwalk and observe all sorts of wildlife such as carpet anemones and mangrove-dwelling fiddler crabs. How to get there: Take a ten-minute bumboat ride from Changi Point Ferry Terminal (S$4 for a one-way trip). Lazarus Island. Besides the beaches at Sentosa or East Coast Park, Lazarus Island is a great destination for an idyllic beach escapade. Think lounging on white sandy shores and dipping your toes in clear turquoise waters. Remember to pack your towels, water and sunscreen though, as the Lazarus Island tropical paradise experience comes without convenience stores. How to get there: Hop on the ferry to St John’s Island from Marina South Pier (S$18 for an adult round-trip ticket, S$12 for children). Then take the link bridge from the St John’s jetty to reach Lazarus Island. Coney Island. Take a trek to Coney Island to get in touch with nature. This rustic green sanctuary is accessible via two bridges, connecting this offshore island to the mainland. There are great cycling trails on the island—we’d recommend cycling over walking, as the terrain can get pretty rugged. The 50-hectare Coney Island Park is also home to a diverse range of Singapore’s flora and fauna and a good spot for bird-watching. Do keep a look out for those long-tailed macaques, and refrain from feeding them. How to get there: From Punggol Point Park, walk about 500 metres east along the Punggol Promenade Nature Walk to get to Coney Island West Entrance. Kusu Island. Mythical tales of tortoises abound at Kusu Island, which has a fascinating story revolving around these shelled creatures (‘kusu’ actually means ‘tortoise’ or ‘turtle’ in Hokkien). Legend has it that a giant tortoise turned itself into an island in order to save two shipwrecked sailors, who then returned to the island to give thanks. In a nod to its origins story, the island is also home to a famous tortoise sanctuary, which houses hundreds of this sacred animal. Visit Kusu Island during the ninth lunar month and you’ll be joined by throngs of people going to the island to pay their respects at the Chinese Da Bo Gong Temple. Visits to the island during this period are very popular, so you may want to reserve a time slot to avoid disappointment. If you're feeling up for a challenge, take on the 152-step climb to the top of the island, where 3 keramats (holy shrines of Malay saints) sit. Many believe them to grant wealth, health and fertility. How to get there: Kusu Island can be reached by ferry from Marina South Pier ($15 for an adult round-trip ticket, $12 for children). Sisters’ Island. Two islands separated by a narrow channel, Sisters’ Island is said to be named after various versions of a folktale where a pair of sisters drowned at sea. Find out which version of the legend you believe when you explore the island, which is a popular spot for picnics and camping. You can also head to the Sisters’ Island Marine Park, home to plenty of Singapore’s native marine biodiversity. How to get there: Sisters’ Island can be reached by ferry from Marina South Pier on weekends and public holidays (S$16 for an adult round-trip ticket, S$12 for children). Tour the Southern Islands. To get a glimpse of each of these islands and admire Singapore’s beautiful coastline, you may want to consider hopping on board a yacht with the Southern Islands Cruise. This two-and-a-half hour jaunt will take you past the Southern Islands—such as Sisters’ Island and St John’s island—and also includes notable locales like Raffles Lighthouse, Sentosa and Marina Bay.",https://www.visitsingapore.com/editorials/explore-singapores-islands/

City Hall. Alight here to explore the Civic District, a must-visit for cultural aficionados. Head to the National Museum of Singapore, the oldest museum in Singapore, and explore its two main galleries, Singapore History Gallery and Singapore Living Galleries. Then, check out the Peranakan Museum—this ten-gallery venue houses the world’s largest overview of Peranakan* life. Here, you’ll learn more about Peranakan food, spirituality, and traditional arts such as embroidery and beadwork. For dining and entertainment in the heart of the city, make your way to Capitol Theatre & Piazza. First built in 1930, then revamped and reopened in 2015, the Capitol Theatre is a meeting point of old and new. While its art deco exterior still remains, it now boasts a modern shopping wing and refurbished facilities. Spruce up your wardrobe with a new suit from CYC Made To Measure, grab a milkshake and hot dog from Capitol Milk Bar and peruse a range of elegant timepieces at Cortina Watch. *The term is an Indonesian/Malay word that means “local born”, which generally refers to people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage. Dhoby Ghaut. If you’re in town around the time of public holidays, be sure to head to the presidential grounds of the Istana, which is occasionally open to the public. The main Istana building was completed in 1869 and the picturesque gardens contain an old Japanese artillery gun, a deeply-wooded grove area, and lily ponds. Pro tip: sign up for guided walks to make the most of your visit there. If you’re up for a short trek, be sure to make a stop at Fort Canning Park for even more lush greenery, with an extra peppering of history. Attractions to check out include the Battle Box (a World War II museum), and the Fort Canning Green, which makes for a great picnic space when it’s not playing host to music festivals. Orchard and Somerset. Naturally, you can’t miss Orchard Road—Singapore’s most famous shopping district. Head to either Orchard or Somerset MRT station (alight at one station and walk the shopping street till you reach the other—do wear your most comfortable pair of shopping shoes), and be wowed by the myriad of retail options available. If you’re starting at Somerset, make a beeline for 313 Somerset and Orchard Central.

While all the grub here will guarantee you a good meal, local favourites include the chicken or duck noodles at Kwee Heng, popiah from Bee Heng Popiah, and barbecued seafood from Sheng Da BBQ Seafood. Toa Payoh and Braddell. Travel a few stops further along the North-South MRT line and you’ll be heading into the heartlands—where the pace of life slows down and the daily lives of locals come to the forefront.

The personal connections made on this itinerary promise that no two travellers will bring home the same experience. At night, the 18 Supertrees in Gardens by the Bay come alive in an exhilarating display of light and sound. Get up-close and personal with majestic beasts at the Night Safari, the world’s first nocturnal zoo. Selling traditional products, from jasmine garlands to Indian cosmetics, Jothi Store and Flower Shop has been a familiar sight in Little India since the 1960s. Singapore is a city of diverse wonders and many names. History buffs may know of it as the Lion City for its rich heritage and diverse cultures, evident in colonial buildings, museums and art galleries. Nature lovers may think of our metropolis as a city in a garden, home to nature sanctuaries, beautiful parks and thriving habitats. Regardless of the name you know it by, this four-day guide will have you exploring various facets of our city, from bustling street culture and heartland haunts to tranquil nature and age-old history. Day 1: Architecture and greenery. Wake up bright and early to birdwatch at Telok Blangah Hill Park. On the 1.3-kilometre-long elevated platform of the Forest Walk, tread lightly and you may get a sight of regional birds like the Pink-necked Green Pigeon and Yellow-vented Bulbul. Between September to March, your patience may also be rewarded by sights of migratory birds like the Black Baza or the Asian Brown Flycatcher. Many of these birds are quite small, so take advantage of the monkey’s-eye view of the canopies on the Forest Walk to seek them out. Henderson Waves—the highest pedestrian walk in Singapore—is another potential birdwatching spot. The bridge’s organic, undulating form is a feat of contemporary architecture, and you’ll find many hidden nooks where you can breathe in the fresh air, 36 metres above the forest floor. From the bridge, take a short walk to HarbourFront Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station. Take the train to Bayfront MRT station and you'll arrived at Gardens by the Bay. Located in the heart of our city, this 101-hectare park is home to flora from all over the world. Break for lunch at Maguerite, helmed by Michelin-starred chef Michael Wilson. The menu here is inspired by contemporary European cuisine, and include beautifully plated dishes like foie gras and king salmon with radish, lime and pepper. Spend the afternoon exploring this beautiful garden, as you stroll through Cloud Forest, get lost amid the metallic, tree-like structures of the Super-Tree Grove and admire the complex ecosystems of the Dragon and Kingfisher Lakes. After spending the day in the Gardens, sniff out an irresistible attraction at Satay by the Bay, where you can sample the skewered meats that give this outdoor food court its name. As you dine along the tree-lined waterfront, you’ll be treated to a stellar view of the sun setting, with hues of red, orange and blue dancing across the bay’s waters and the soaring skyscrapers of the Civic District. Day 2: History. First opened in 1970, People’s Park Complex is your first stop for the day, with its history, heritage and colourful sights. As you join the crowd, look out for  buskers on traditional Chinese instruments like the erhu (Chinese violin) and guzheng (16-string plucked instrument). Their musical expertise has been the life of this site for decades. Just a stone’s throw away, you’ll find Chinatown Complex Market & Food Centre, which houses heritage trades and hawker food galore. The stalls here sell a charming mix of fashion accessories, traditional threads and cosmetics, so be sure to spend some time treasure hunting. For lunch, stop by the Chinatown Complex’s 2nd floor, where you’ll find the largest hawker centre in Singapore. With more than 260 stalls, this food paradise is a prime example of why Singapore is considered one of the world’s culinary capitals. We recommend sampling the dishes from Liao Fan Hawker Chan, Old Amoy Chendol and Lian He Ben Ji Claypot. Work off your lunch by walking through the Civic District, where you’ll find an eclectic mix of buildings range from the historical to the consummately modern. The highlight of your stroll is the National Gallery Singapore, a striking art institution housed within the neoclassical buildings of or former City Hall and Supreme Court. The gallery boasts the world’s largest collection of modern Southeast Asian artwork, as well as pieces by feted local artists like Liu Kang and Georgette Chen. Heed the rumbling of your tummy when dinnertime rolls along and head to National Kitchen by Violet Oon. The restaurant is proudly Peranakan (Straits-born people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage), serving up fiery dishes for which the community is renowned. Like the food, the restaurant’s décor of antique furniture and black-and-white photos from Oon’s personal collection comes straight from the heart. Day 3: Nature & Wildlife. Spend your third day in Singapore exploring nature off the coast, with a trip to the Chek Jawa wetlands, on the island sanctuary of Pulau Ubin. Food options are a little scarce, so you may want to pack a picnic basket for your visit. Comprising over 100 hectares, this beautiful locale is home to six distinct habitats, from seagrass lagoons to sandy and rocky beaches. You’ll be able to best explore the latter with an intertidal walk, where the water recedes at low tide to reveal a trove of diverse marine wildlife. You can book a tour with NParks, or time your visit to coincide with the low tide (check out this page for a handy tide table). Back ashore in mainland Singapore, hop on a bus or taxi to the Singapore Zoo which adopts a unique open zoo setting for an unforgettable experience. Get up-close with free-roaming animals such as the two-toed sloth and mousedeer at Fragile Forest, and spot the adorable orangutan family right above your heads at the world’s first free-ranging orangutan habitat. When twilight falls, check out the world’s first nocturnal wildlife park, the Night Safari, located just next door. Enjoy a sumptuous Asian Buffet dinner at Ulu Ulu Safari Restaurant before starting your adventure into the wild. Home to almost 900 nocturnal animals, catch a glimpse of Malayan Tapirs, Spotted Hyenas and the park icon - Chawang the Asian Elephant onboard the Tram Safari. Meet the Southern Three-banded Armadillo at the Explorer Outpost along Fishing Cat Trail, and round off your nocturnal adventures with the exhilarating Creatures of the Night Show. Day 4: Neighbourhoods. Dedicate your fourth day in Singapore to a foray into local haunts and culture. Your first stop—the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple—was built in the 1850s and is one of Singapore’s oldest Hindu temples. Take in the gorgeous architecture, and admire the intricate temple interiors, but be sure to check out the guidelines on temple etiquette before visiting. Take a short walk to Jothi Store & Flower Shop. The store began life, in the 1960s, as a modest flower shop, but has since grown into a full-blown enterprise, supplying garlands to almost all Hindu temples and Indian weddings in Singapore. Have a chat with the owner Rajakumar Chandra—he’s also the chairman of the Little India Shopkeepers & Heritage Association—and you might just learn a few secrets about the historical precinct. While you’re there, breathe in the sweet aroma of jasmine flowers, incense, camphor and other spices as he regales you with tales of this storied neighbourhood. As you leave the store, you’ll be looking at the narrow back lanes and streets of Little India around you with new eyes. Just across the road from the shop is Ananda Bhavan Restaurant. At almost a century old, this local chain of vegetarian Indian restaurants claims to be the oldest of its kind in the city. Go for the full experience and devour a plate of thosai (savoury pancake), washed down with a mug of sweet masala chai (spiced tea). Although cutlery is available, this is the best place to learn how to eat with your hands. Next, pay a visit to Kampong Gelam, the historical seat of the local Malay aristocracy. While we no longer have a Sultan (Muslim sovereign), this area has retained most of its historical architecture. The Sultan’s palace has been repurposed as the Malay Heritage Centre, and the mosque he built, the Masjid Sultan, remains a crucial part of our Muslim community. If you’re looking for unique souvenirs, take a walk down Haji Lane, which is brimming with hip boutiques. Cap off your day with dinner and drinks at Blu Jaz Café, a popular haunt of local performers and musicians.
